# @bsi-cx/scaffold-design

A simple scaffold template for [BSI CX](https://www.bsi-software.com/en/cx) designs. This repository should be a good
foundation to create a new template. So fork
or [download](https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-build/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository to create
your own BSI CX design. This repository uses
the [BSI CX design build](https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-build) based on webpack. Checkout
the [Wiki](https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-build/wiki) to get more information on the design build. To get
more information on BSI CX designs, checkout our [online documentation](https://bsi-software.github.io/bsi-cx-docs/).

## Usage

Use this template, if you have to start from scratch and adjusting
the [master template](https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-master-template-web) would be too much work. Be
aware, that this template really is not more than a scaffold. This is exactly the scope of this template:
providing a structure. The template only contains a minimal working examples and no complete design.
